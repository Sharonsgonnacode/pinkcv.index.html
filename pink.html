<p style = "font-size: 25px; font-color: pink"> I achieved a PGCE in Further Education and Training at Edge Hill University in 2019, specialising in English. On placement at St. Helens College, I taught English at Functional skills level, GCSE and A-level, planning 100 solo hours of teaching English.
Since qualifying, I have been employed as a supply English teacher and cover supervisor in various schools and a college, as well as, a teaching assistant in SEND environments. This employment has provided me with a wide range of experience in different schools and a college, in a variety of subjects.
I was furloughed in March and gained part time work in August as a community support worker in the evenings. I began working full time with Randstad as a survey tester in September and resigned from support work in December. The contract for survey testing finishes in March 2022 and ultimately, I am seeking a position where I can secure QTS or QTLS and an English teaching career.<br>
